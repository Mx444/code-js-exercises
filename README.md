# JavaScript Exercises and Projects

This directory contains a collection of small JavaScript exercises and projects developed as part of a learning journey. Each subdirectory typically represents a self-contained exercise or a small web application demonstrating specific concepts.

## Directory Structure

The `src` directory is organized into two main sections:

-   **exercises/**: Contains various smaller exercises, likely focusing on specific JavaScript concepts or problem-solving tasks.
    -   `api-exercises/`: Exercises potentially involving fetching and working with APIs.
    -   `ex_1/`, `ex_2/`, `ex_3/`: Numbered exercises, likely following a curriculum or sequence.
-   **project/**: Contains slightly larger, self-contained projects that function as small web applications.
    -   `binario/`: Project possibly related to binary numbers or conversions.
    -   `conta_mance/`: Project likely related to calculating tips or managing expenses.
    -   `contact/`: Project potentially involving a contact form or contact list management.
    -   `libreria/`: Project possibly related to a library or book management.
    -   `voli/`: Project likely related to flights or travel information.

Each exercise or project subdirectory typically contains:
-   `index.html`: The main HTML file to open the project in a browser.
-   `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file containing the application logic.
-   (Optional) `css/`: Directory for styling files if present.

## How to Run

To run any of the exercises or projects:

1.  Navigate into the specific exercise or project directory (e.g., `src/project/conta_mance/`).
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

Most projects are designed to run directly in the browser without requiring a local web server.

## Technologies Used

The projects primarily utilize standard web technologies:

-   HTML for structure
-   CSS for styling
-   JavaScript for functionality

Individual projects may include specific libraries or frameworks, but the core is built with vanilla JavaScript.
